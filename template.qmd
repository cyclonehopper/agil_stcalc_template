## Basis of Design									

In general, design shall be in accordance with AS 4100 and other required standards.

## Design Standards and Codes
Unless specifically noted, the design complies with Australian Standards and selected international standards as listed in the Design Criteria. The following summarises the key standards used in producing this calculation:

* AS 1170.0 - 2002		Structural design actions - Part 0: General principles
* AS 1170.1 - 2002		Structural design actions - Part 1: Permanent, imposed and other actions
* AS 1170.2 - 2021		Structural design actions - Part 2: Wind actions
* AS 1170.4 - 2007		Structural design actions - Part 4: Earthquake Actions in Australia
* AS 3600 - 2018		Concrete structures
* AS 4100 - 1998		Steel structures
